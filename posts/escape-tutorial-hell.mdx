Every year the number of available JavaScript frontend frameworks increases and developers get stuck in a so-called "tutorial-hell".
One reason is that youtube recommends them new programming tutorials in their feed with many different frameworks that are unknown to the web developer.

Because they have great titles sometimes praising the unique features of this framework or advertising that you can get into FAANG with knowledge of this framework.
Most times these titles are just clickbait. No, Google won't hire them because they know how to make a TODO list using [Angular](https://angular.io/), but they need experts with
extensive JavaScript knowledge to develop the frameworks themselves.

## Learn concepts not frameworks.

The most important thing is to learn the concepts behind coding an application, not how to use a single dependency or what is the best way to build something in a framework.
If you look at the image above, you can see that the number of major frontend frameworks is increases with each passing year, but there is no need to know them all.

For example, if you know the concept behind an API and how to use it with your frontend, it doesn't matter if you learned it with the latest framework or an old one.
If you know the concept and how to do it with [Angular](https://angular.io/), you will be able to do the same with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

_(Even if you have to spend a few minutes looking it up on Stackoverflow.)_

More important knowing a framework will not help you to solve a coding problem that you will face at some pouint in your personal projects or more importantly in your professional career.
No company is going to you to build the 300th TODO-list program, but mostly to extend an already existing software. The sad news here is that there is will no tutorial solving the problems of your assigned programming task.

## Tutorials do not teach you how to be a programmer

Tutorials only show how a certain application is build with a certain framework. The viewer watches the video and meanwhile copies the code someone else has thought about.
You may remember the code of the other person's code in the future or just forget it again, but more importantly, the learning process you normally have while thinking
about the code and programming it yourself is not happening.

In my opinion the best way to learn fundamentals and concepts is by building a project on your own from scratch.
Think about something you maybe want to have in the future, like a personal page.
Then choose your favorite framework and start building your project.
While creating your project you will get stuck at some points.
Now tutorials, besides Stackoverflow, can be helpful because they can help you get a new idea on how to solve the problem without destroying the learning effect.

## Possible beginner project ideas

Some possible projects you could program to learn the fundamentals.

- Personal page
- Calculator
- Chess game
- Clone existing webpage _(Instagram or Facebook, ...)_

## Conclusion

You should practice hard by doing your own things without copying other people's code. Repetition is the key to understand and remember important concepts.
