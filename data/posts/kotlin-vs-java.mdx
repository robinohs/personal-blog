excerpt: Java is one of the most used programming languages among developers but due to its old age it lacks some modern concepts like for example null safety. This is where Kotlin comes in.
---

Kotlin was in development for 5 years until it received its first stable release and is being developed by JetBrains as an open source project.
One of the main reasons for the rapid adoption was that Kotlin replaced Java as the [preferred programming language for native Android development](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first).

Kotlin introduces many modern programming language concepts, such as Null safety or the need to declare whether a variable can be changed in the future (variable) or remains constant (value).
Despite the fact that Kotlin has a different syntax than Java, it remains fully interoperable with Java code.

## Null safety by default.

A common exception in Java are so-called "null pointer exceptions", which usually occur when a developer forgets or simply thinks that it is not necessary to check for possible null values.
In Kotlin, a developer must explicitly state that a variable can be null (The variable is "nullable").

```Kotlin
// not nullable
var number: Int = 5

// nullable
var number: Int? = null
```

Also nullable variables need to be checked for null before they can be used.

```Kotlin
var myName: String? = "Robin"

// results in an error because a nullable variable is used without security check
myName.length
```

## Extension Functions.

With Kotlin we get the ability to extend a class without touching the class itself or using design patterns.
For example if we have defined a data class like so:

```Kotlin
data class Value(val first: Int, val second: Int)
```

We now can add functionality to it with a extension function. This function does not need to be declared inside the class.

```Kotlin
fun Value.sumUp(): Int {
  return first + second
}
```

It can now be used in the following ways.

```Kotlin
val value = Value(5, 7)
val sum = value.sumUp()
```

At first glance, this doesn't look like a great feature, but it's a great option when you're working with design principles like SOLID because it's easy to split different features across different files.

It is also possible to override extension functions of open classes in subclasses which is nice for design patterns.

## Full interoperability with Java
You may ask, why should I leave my Java ecosystem with many nice frameworks like Spring Boot or libraries like Apache Commons to use Kotlin?

Well, you don't have to! Kotlin is designed to be interoperable with Java. Java code can be called from Kotlin without any problems.

If you have an old Java project, it is even possible to mix Java and Kotlin code in
one project by adding the Kotlin dependencies to the existing JVM project.

### Convert Java code to Kotlin
If you are programming with IntelliJ from Jetbrains, you can also use a built-in feature of the IDE to convert Java code to Kotlin code.
Well, the converted code is not perfect and often does not take advantage of all the possible features Kotlin offers, but the results are often times amazing.

You can often get rid of a lot of boilerplate code that is needed in Java. The resulting code base will has the same features as the original Java code, but
it is possible to reduce the number of lines of code by about 20 percent (4).
