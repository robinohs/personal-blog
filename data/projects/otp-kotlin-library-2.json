  "description": "This library can be used by any Kotlin application to validate and generate 2-factor authentication codes. It supports the creation of randomly secure secrets in Base32 encoding that can be used to exchange with clients, who can then use this secret in their preferred authentication application. Another feature is the creation of randomly secure recovery codes that can be used in case a user loses access to their 2-factor authentication device. High customizability allows the developer to specify the number of digits generated in the codes, the character set used to generate secrets, the length of the generated secrets, and much more. ",
